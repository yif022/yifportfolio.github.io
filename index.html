									<a href="https://github.com/yif022/Udacity-Projects/tree/main/bike-sharing-demand" class="image fit"><img src="images/capital-bikeshare.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, the AutoGluon library was employed to train multiple models 
										for the Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand competition. The primary objective was to 
										rank the models based on their performance in predicting bike rental demand, 
										considering various features such as season, weather, and temperature. Utilizing 
										Tabular Prediction, the data from CSV files provided by the competition was effectively 
										processed. This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in utilizing AutoGluon 
										for tabular prediction tasks. It showcases my ability to iterate through models, optimizing 
										them to address real-world challenges. The experience gained from this project underscores 
										my capability to navigate and excel in competitive environments, making it a valuable 
										addition to my portfolio.</p>

									<p>In this AI application development project, I successfully trained an image classifier to recognize
										various species of flowers. The goal was to create a versatile model that could be integrated into 
										different applications, such as a smartphone app capable of identifying flowers captured by the 
										camera.

										The project was executed in several key steps:

										<strong>Loading and Preprocessing the Image Dataset:</strong> I used the torchvision library to load and preprocess 
										the dataset, applying transformations like random scaling, cropping, and flipping for training. The 
										images were normalized according to the specifications of the pre-trained models.
										
										<strong>Training the Image Classifier:</strong> Leveraging pre-trained models from torchvision, I built and trained 
										a new feed-forward classifier using the features extracted from the images. The classifier utilized 
										ReLU activations and dropout for improved performance. The training process involved backpropagation 
										and optimization to achieve the best hyperparameters. 
										<strong>Predicting Image Content:</strong> Once the classifier was trained, it could predict the content of images, 
										specifically identifying different species of flowers. This functionality could be extended to any 
										set of labeled images, making the model adaptable for various applications.</p>

									<p>In this project, I undertook the challenge of refining an image classification 
										application that lacked crucial Python codes. The primary aim was to assess and 
										showcase my proficiency in Python programming. By completing the missing code segments, 
										I systematically evaluated three CNN architectures—AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet—for their
										effectiveness in classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs." Furthermore, I thoroughly 
										examined the accuracy of the chosen architecture in identifying specific dog breeds.</p>

									<p>In this project, I conducted preprocessing on the MNIST dataset for recognizing 
										handwritten digits, constructed a neural network, and subsequently trained and 
										refined the model. The primary aim was to attain superior accuracy in identifying 
										handwritten digits. The project encompassed multiple phases, including data 
										preprocessing, defining the model architecture, conducting training, evaluation, 
										and optimization. The resulting model achieved an impressive test accuracy of 97%.</p>

									<p>In this project, I applied my skills in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build 
										a landmark classifier. The goal was to predict the location of images based on landmarks 
										depicted in them, addressing challenges where photos lack location metadata. The project 
										involved end-to-end machine learning processes, including data preprocessing, CNN design 
										and training, model comparison, and app deployment.</p>

									<p>In this project, I constructed an image classification model using AWS SageMaker with the 
										goal of refining the logistics for a company specializing in scone delivery. The model's 
										purpose was to autonomously identify the specific type of vehicle employed by delivery 
										drivers. This classification holds significant importance in streamlining routing processes, 
										ensuring that orders in close proximity are assigned to bicycle-riding delivery professionals,
										while more distant deliveries are entrusted to motorcyclists.

										Computer Vision for Image Classification
										Model Training and Deployment
										Event-Driven Application Architecture
										Scalable and Safe Machine Learning Practices</p>
